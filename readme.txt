== Description ==
WP Fresh is a simple and lightweight WordPress plugin developed by DesignThat Cloud. It automates the process of removing the sample post and page that are automatically created when setting up a new WordPress site. Additionally, it removes the Hello Dolly and Akismet plugins, whether they are activated or not. The plugin also recommends installing the Cloudflare plugin to enhance website performance and security.

== Benefits ==
1. Save time: Instead of manually deleting the sample post and page, as well as deactivating and deleting the Hello Dolly and Akismet plugins, WP Fresh streamlines the process by automating these tasks. This allows you to quickly start with a clean slate and focus on building your website.

2. Improve security: Removing the sample post and page eliminates unnecessary content that could potentially expose sensitive information about your site. Moreover, deleting unused plugins like Hello Dolly and Akismet reduces the attack surface and minimizes potential vulnerabilities.

3. Simplify setup: WP Fresh simplifies the initial setup of a WordPress site by removing default content that may not be relevant to your needs. This helps you start with a blank canvas, allowing you to tailor your site's content and plugin selection according to your specific requirements.

4. Cloudflare integration: WP Fresh recommends installing the Cloudflare plugin to enhance your website's performance and security. Cloudflare offers a range of features such as CDN, caching, DDoS protection, and more.

1. Upload the `wp-fresh-by-designthat-cloud` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the "WP Fresh" plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Upon activation, the plugin will automatically delete the sample post and page, remove the Hello Dolly and Akismet plugins, and recommend installing the Cloudflare plugin.
